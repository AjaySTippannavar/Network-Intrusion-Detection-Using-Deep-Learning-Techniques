Intelligent deep learning-based system for real-time detection and prevention of cyberattacks in network traffic. The project "Network Intrusion Detection System Using Deep Learning Techniques" aims to develop an intelligent and adaptive system that detects and prevents cyberattacks in real time using deep learning models. Traditional intrusion detection systems often fail to identify unknown or zero-day attacks, leading to low accuracy and high false positives. This project addresses that limitation using models like CNN, DNN, SNN, and Attention-based architectures, trained on benchmark datasets such as NSL-KDD, Kyoto2006+, and UNSW-NB15. Data preprocessing, including normalization and feature encoding, enhances model performance, while optimization with Adam and categorical cross-entropy ensures efficient convergence. The system is deployed via a Flask-based web application featuring real-time dashboards, REST API support, and automated email/SMS alerts. Overall, it demonstrates how deep learning improves detection accuracy and reduces false positives, strengthening network security against modern threats.
